Slinding window technique helps us to reduce the time complexity of an algorithm from O(N^2) or higher time
complexity to O(N)
There are two types of sliding window techniques:
1. Fixed Size where the window size is fixed throughout the iteration of the array
2. Resizeable window size that is like a caterpillar moving one part of the body once and moving the other
part next time
