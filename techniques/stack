There are two types of stack :
1. monotonic stack which is either increasing or decreasing
2. non monotonic stack
NB. How to know monotonic stack problem:
> It is a “range queries in an array” problem
> The minima/maxima element or the monotonic order
of elements in a range is useful to get answer of every range query.
> When a element is popped from the monotonic stack, it will never be used again.
