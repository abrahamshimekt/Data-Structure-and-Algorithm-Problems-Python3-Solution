Two pointers are the way of reducing the time complexity of an algorithm from O(N^2) and bigger to O(N)
by applying two or more pointing variables.
There are two types of two pointers :
1. equidirectional (all pointers start from the same direction)
2. opposite directional (start from opposite ends)
